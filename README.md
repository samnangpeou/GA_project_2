# Ames Housing Project

## Problem statement 

What is the recipe for a valuable home in Ames, Iowa? If I were to build a house on an empty lot, where should my focus be?


## Goal
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

## Research: 

Data cleaning with this data set was so incredibly crucial. For every fillna() or dropna() or drop() the model will read it totally differently. For i in struggled return (decent kaggle score). With this project, there are so many different EDA/model techniques to be learned that you apply almost all of them. I'm 2nd place, very disappointing, but, I take away the skills to be able to clean a semi-medium data set in a trillion different ways to only place 2nd.
